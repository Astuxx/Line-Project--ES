(1) if the death occurred within ten years after the payment agreement or
(2) later if the total claims amount (consisting of annuity elements paid to the claimant and the
lump-sum settlement amount) would be less than or equal to the indexed priority applicable
for the discharge of the annuities of the claim.
(b) Due to the claimant’s entitlement to claim a different amount linked to the change of the medical
status, the claim shall be reopened in order to recalculate the capital for health and care annuities, if
(1) an unexpected aggravation or considerable improvement of claimant’s health status occurs
within ten years after the payment agreement and
(2) aggravation is ascertained as a direct result of the loss event by a certified medical
institution or an impartial medical expert
(3) the evaluation of the indexed linked benefits exceeds in total more than 10% deviation.
(c) If the Reinsured successfully agrees a lump-sum- agreement with the claimant within ten years after
the payment agreement, the Reinsured shall be obliged to report this together with the settlement
parameter immediately to the Reinsurers.
In the event that the amounts of the lump-sum-settlement are based on different calculation parameters and
figures comparing to the payment agreement, the Reinsurer shall be entitled to a refund if the total
claims amount (consisting of annuity elements paid to the claimant and the lumpsum settlement
amount) would be less than the total claims amount which was based to the payment agreement.
(d) In case of reopening or adjustment of a claim the new basic capital shall be calculated on actuarial
rules and in accordance with the rules outlined in paragraph I. lit a) – d) above; the Index Clause
shall be applied with the date of the actuarial calculation. The outstanding reserve for annuity at the
first payment agreement shall be deemed as settled during the first agreement.

SPECIAL TERMINATION CLAUSE
1. Either party shall have the right to terminate this Reinsurance immediately by giving the other party
notice:-
(i) if the performance of the whole or any part of this Reinsurance be prohibited or rendered
impossible de jure or de facto in particular and without prejudice to the generality of the
preceding words in consequence of any law or regulation which is or shall be in force in any
country or territory or if any law or regulation shall prevent directly or indirectly the remittance of
any payments due to or from either party,
(ii) if the other party has become insolvent or unable to pay its debts or has lost the whole or any
part of its paid up capital or has had any authority to transact any class of insurance or
reinsurance withdrawn, suspended or made conditional,
(iii) if there is any material change in the management or control of the other party,
(iv) if the country or territory in which the other party is domiciled shall be itself subject to armed
hostilities with any other country whether war be declared or not or is partly or wholly occupied
by another power and such armed hostilities or occupation substantially impairs the ability of
that party to perform its obligations under this Reinsurance.
2. After the date of termination, the liability of the Reinsurer hereunder shall cease outright other than
in respect of losses which have occurred prior thereto.
3. All notices of termination served in accordance with any of the provisions of paragraph 1 above shall
be by telex, telefax or any other means of instantaneous communication that provides a permanent
record of such communication and shall be deemed to be served upon dispatch or where
communications between the parties are interrupted upon attempted dispatch.
4. All notices of termination served in accordance with any of the provisions of paragraph 1 above shall
be addressed to the Company Secretary of the party concerned at its head office or at any other
address previously designated by that party.
5. In the event of termination in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 1 above, then the
premium due to Reinsurers shall be calculated upon the Premium Income of the Reinsured up to the
date of termination or pro rata temporis of the Minimum Premium, whichever is the greater. Any
Reinstatement Premium however, shall continue to be based on the full premium, which would have
been finally earned hereunder for the Period.
6. In the event of conflict between this Special Termination Clause and other provisions of this
Reinsurance, the provisions of this Special Termination Clause shall prevail.
7. Notwithstanding the provisions of items of the termination clause above, the right of either party to
invoke the termination of this Reinsurance shall not arise solely due to either party being unable to
fulfil their obligation of the whole or any part of this Contract, due to any sanctions, prohibition or
restriction under United Nations resolutions or the trade or economic sanctions, laws or regulations
of any jurisdiction applicable to that party to the reinsurance contract.

any part of its policyholders, unless and until the Reinsurers serve written notice to the contrary
on the Reinsured in relation to any composition or scheme of arrangement.

REINSURERS
LIABILITY:
(Re)insurer’s liability several not joint
The liability of a (re)insurer under this contract is several and not joint with other (re)insurers party to this
contract. A (re)insurer is liable only for the proportion of liability it has underwritten. A (re)insurer is not jointly
liable for the proportion of liability underwritten by any other (re)insurer. Nor is a (re)insurer otherwise
responsible for any liability of any other (re)insurer that may underwrite this contract.
The proportion of liability under this contract underwritten by a (re)insurer (or, in the case of a Lloyd’s
syndicate, the total of the proportions underwritten by all the members of the syndicate taken together) is
shown next to its stamp. This is subject always to the provision concerning “signing” below.
In the case of a Lloyd’s syndicate, each member of the syndicate (rather than the syndicate itself) is a
(re)insurer. Each member has underwritten a proportion of the total shown for the syndicate (that total itself
being the total of the proportions underwritten by all the members of the syndicate taken together). The
liability of each member of the syndicate is several and not joint with other members. A member is liable only
for that member’s proportion. A member is not jointly liable for any other member’s proportion. Nor is any
member otherwise responsible for any liability of any other (re)insurer that may underwrite this contract. The
business address of each member is Lloyd’s, One Lime Street, London EC3M 7HA. The identity of each
member of a Lloyd’s syndicate and their respective proportion may be obtained by writing to Market
Services, Lloyd’s, at the above address.
Proportion of liability
Unless there is “signing” (see below), the proportion of liability under this contract underwritten by each
(re)insurer (or, in the case of a Lloyd’s syndicate, the total of the proportions underwritten by all the
members of the syndicate taken together) is shown next to its stamp and is referred to as its “written line”.
Where this contract permits, written lines, or certain written lines, may be adjusted (“signed”). In that case a
schedule is to be appended to this contract to show the definitive proportion of liability under this contract
underwritten by each (re)insurer (or, in the case of a Lloyd’s syndicate, the total of the proportions
underwritten by all the members of the syndicate taken together). A definitive proportion (or, in the case of a
Lloyd’s syndicate, the total of the proportions underwritten by all the members of a Lloyd’s syndicate taken
together) is referred to as a “signed line”. The signed lines shown in the schedule will prevail over the written
lines unless a proven error in calculation has occurred.
Although reference is made at various points in this clause to “this contract” in the singular, where the
circumstances so require this should be read as a reference to contracts in the plural.
