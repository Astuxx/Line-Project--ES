                      1.1         MINIMUM ESSENTIAL MEDICAL AND SURVIVAL EQUIPMENT FOR SHIP 
                      LIFE RAFTS INCLUDING GUIDELINES FOR SURVIVAL AT SEA 
                      1.         The aim of this document is to standardize on a minimum list of essential items 
                      as components of the first-aid medical equipment for ship life rafts of the navies of 
                      NATO nations and to recommend a list of additional items for survival and rescue. This 
                      document also contains recommended guidelines to be followed for survival. 
                      2.         Participating nations are strongly encouraged to utilize the guidelines and 
                      recommendations included herein in providing survival equipment for life rafts. The 
                      guidelines should be available in ships and ship life rafts.

                      1.         Life raft - for purposes of this publication by this name we generally mean all 
                      vessels designed for saving shipwreck survivors: 
                                life boat (LB) 
                                life raft    (LR) 
                                combined life and rescue boat (LB/RB) 
                                rescue boat (RB), including fast rescue boat

                      1.3        GENERAL PRINCIPLES 
                      1.          Many analyses of naval disasters have revealed that despite many 
                      technological developments in survival aids there are very limited chances of survival 
                      in extreme conditions, in the absence of adequate preparedness. Thus proper 
                      knowledge and careful pre-planning are mandatory for safety of everybody onboard. 
                      All people onboard ship should be instructed on how to behave in case of emergency 
                      abandoning the ship. 
                                                                                        1-1                                  Edition A Version 2

                      2.         The biggest stress should be laid on protection from the hazards of the 
                      environment. As experience has shown, cold is the most life threatening hazard to the 
                      shipwreck survivor. 
                      3.         Water supply has a higher priority than nutrition, as there are studies showing 
                      that man can survive without food for a few weeks and only a very few days without 
                      water.

                                 covering all exposed skin.

                                             possible replace with woolen clothing to skin. Take off vapour barrier 
                                             garments and use to increase floor and overall covering of survivors. 
                                             Take off shoes and keep feet warm by tucking them into each others 
                                             clothes

                           8. Manoeuvre towards other life rafts, secure life rafts together and distribute 
                                 survivors and equipment between survival craft. 
                           9. Arrange watches and duties. 
                           10. Check life raft for correct operation and any damage and repair as appropriate 
                                 (ventilate if CO        2 leaking into life raft).
