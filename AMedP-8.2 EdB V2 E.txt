                      2.1        GENERAL 
                      It is important for the further treatment of a wounded service person that the military 
                      clinical record is following the service person from one hospital to another, no matter if 
                      it is between allied hospitals or back to a national hospital. This record will contain a 
                      minimum of information and will be standardized. 
                      2.2        AIM 
                      The aim of this Allied Medical Publication is to standardize the minimum information to 
                      be included in a Basic military medical report when patients from one nation are treated 
                      in hospitals of other nations and how to handle this information when patient are 
                      transferred from one MTF to another military or civilian hospital.

                      therein will be treated like all other medical information with respect to confidentiality. 
                      2.         When a patient of one allied nation is treated in a military hospital of another 
                      nation, a Basic Military Medical Report will be prepared for her/him. This record will 
                      accompany the patient upon transfer between Military Medical installations/Hospitals 
                      or back to parent nation. 
                      3.         The record will be forwarded to the patient’s national                                 military medical authority 
                      according to Annex A, when: 
                                 a.         The treatment of the patient is completed, 
                                 b.         The patient is discharged from the hospital or dies,
