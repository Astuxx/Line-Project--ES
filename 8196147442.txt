REINSURERS LIABILITY Reinsurers Liability Clause LMA3333
Reinsurer's liability several not joint.
The liability of a Reinsurer under this Agreement is several and not joint with other Reinsurers party to this Agreement. A Reinsurer is liable only for the proportion of liability it has underwritten. A Reinsurer is not jointly liable for the proportion of liability underwritten by any other Reinsurer. Nor is a Reinsurer otherwise responsible for any liability of any other Reinsurer that may underwrite this Agreement.
The proportion of liability under this Agreement underwritten by a Reinsurer (or, in the case of a Lloyd's syndicate, the total of the proportions underwritten by all the members of the syndicate taken together) is shown next to its stamp. This is subject always to the provision concerning "signing" below.
In the case of a Lloyd's syndicate, each member of the syndicate (rather than the syndicate itself) is a Reinsurer. Each member has underwritten a proportion of the total shown for the syndicate (that total itself being the total of the proportions underwritten by all the members of the syndicate taken together). The liability of each member of the syndicate is several and not joint with other members. A member is liable only for that member's proportion. A member is not jointly liable for any other member's proportion. Nor is any member otherwise responsible for any liability of any other Reinsurer that may underwrite this Agreement. The business address of each member is Lloyd's, One Lime Street, London EC3M 7HA. The identity of each member of a Lloyd's syndicate and their respective proportion may be obtained by writing to Market Services, Lloyd's, at the above address.
Proportion of liability
Unless there is "signing" (see below), the proportion of liability under this Agreement underwritten by each Reinsurer (or, in the case of a Lloyd's syndicate, the total of the proportions underwritten by all the members of the syndicate taken together) is shown next to its stamp and is referred to as its "written line".
Where this Agreement permits, written lines, or certain written lines, may be adjusted ("signed"). In that case a schedule is to be appended to this Agreement to show the definitive proportion of liability under this Agreement underwritten by each Reinsurer (or, in the case of a Lloyd's syndicate, the total of the proportions underwritten by all the members of the syndicate taken together). A definitive proportion (or, in the case of a Lloyd's syndicate, the total of the proportions underwritten by all the members of a Lloyd's syndicate taken together) is referred to as a "signed Security Details Page 1

line". The signed lines shown in the schedule will prevail over the written lines unless a proven error in calculation has occurred.
Although reference is made at various points in this clause to "this Agreement" in the singular, where the circumstances so require this should be read as a reference to Agreements in the plural.

However:
a) in the event that the placement of the order is not completed by the commencement date of the period of this Agreement then all lines written by that date will be signed in full;
b) the Reinsured may elect for the disproportionate signing of Reinsurers' lines, without further specific agreement of Reinsurers, providing that any such variation is made prior to the commencement date of the period of this Agreement, and that lines written "to stand" may not be varied without the documented agreement of those Reinsurers;
c) the signed lines resulting from the application of the above provisions can be varied, before or after the commencement date of the period of this Agreement, by the documented agreement of the Reinsured and all Reinsurers whose lines are to be varied. The variation to the Agreements will take effect only when all such Reinsurers have agreed, with the resulting variation in signed lines commencing from the date set out in that Agreement.
