                                   CHAPTER 1 - MINIMUM CONDITIONS FOR SURVIVAL IN A 
                       DISTRESSED SUBMARINE (DISSUB) PRIOR TO ESCAPE OR RESCUE 
                      1.1. PURPOSE 
                      a. Identify the important physiological and environmental factors that influence survival in a 
                          DISSUB pending escape or rescue. 
                      b. Where possible, quantify these factors (in terms of minimum/maximum acceptable levels) and 
                          thus ensure that both the physical and mental functions of the survivors remain at a level 
                          necessary to enable them to effect an escape or rescue. 
                      1.2. DEFINITIONS 
                      The following terms and definitions are used for the purpose of this agreement: 
                      a. 1 bar is approximately equivalent to: 1 ATA; 100 kPa; 10 msw; 33 fsw; 760 mmHg; 760 Torr. 
                      b. Standard Temperature & Pressure (STP) is 0Â°C and 760 Torr. 
                      c. Normal constituent of air: 
                      (1) Nitrogen: 78% by volume (0.78 bar partial pressure at 1bar) 
                      (2) Oxygen: 21% by volume (0.21 bar partial pressure at 1bar) 
                      (3) Carbon Dioxide: 0.04 % by volume (0.0004 bar partial pressure at 1bar) 
                      d. High concentrations are normally expressed in volume percent (Vol.%). i.e. 1 part of a 
                      substance in 100 parts of air. Air consists of 21 Vol.% oxygen. (i.e. 100 parts of air contain 21 
                      parts of oxygen). 
                      e. In smaller concentrations the engineering unit 'parts per million' is used (ppm). The 
                      concentration ppm means 1 part of a substance in 1 million parts of air. 1 Vol.% = 10,000 ppm. 
                      f. Partial Pressure: the pressure a gas would exert if it alone occupied the same volume as the 
                      whole gas mixture. 
                      1.3. GENERAL DETAILS 
                      Survivors in a DISSUB are faced with determining the best method of returning to the surface. 
                      The safest way may be to await rescue and be transferred to the surface in a rescue vehicle. 
                      Alternatively, escape may be the best option, particularly if conditions within the DISSUB are 
                      deteriorating or the sinking is in a remote area. Escape necessitates the survivors exposing 
                      themselves to the external environment in what is essentially a bounce dive, possibly 
                      superimposed over a saturation decompression obligation. 
                      The longer the survivors spend in the DISSUB the more likely the environmental conditions will 
                      deteriorate and result in adverse affects on the physical and mental wellbeing of the survivors. 
                      These in turn affect the capability of undertaking an escape or continuing to await rescue. Many 
                      of the DISSUB environmental factors are inter-related and time dependant. The way in which 
                      these factors interrelate is largely unknown. 
                                                                                                                                    Edition (A) Version (1)

                                        ANNEX 1.A. CONDITIONS FOR SURVIVAL IN A DISSUB SCENARIO 
                      1.A.1. THE DISSUB INTERNAL PRESSURE 
                      1. Rescue considerations. Past experience has demonstrated that a DISSUB is invariably 
                      pressurised to a certain degree. If exposed to a pressure of 1.7 bar or above for a period of time 
                      the DISSUB survivors have a decompression obligation once rescued. Survival for up to 1 week 
                      at an internal pressure of around 5 bar is considered possible, however it should be noted that 
                      this has never been proven scientifically. This magnitude of exposure will result in a deterioration 
                      of lung function due to pulmonary oxygen toxicity that gets progressively worse above an oxygen 
                      partial pressure of 0.5 bar. Above 5 bar mental ability rapidly deteriorates due to nitrogen 
                      narcosis and cerebral oxygen toxicity (above an oxygen partial pressure of 1.6 bar). 
                      2. Escape considerations. The safety of escape is dependant on the type of escape system 
                      being used (national variation), the depth of the DISSUB and the internal pressure within the 
                      DISSUB. Laboratory experiments have demonstrated that return to surface pressure from a 
                      DISSUB internal pressure of 1.7 bar or less results in a low incidence of decompression illness                                              (i). 
                      Further and more detailed information is provided in A/MTP 57. 
                      1.A.2. THE DISSUB ATMOSPHERE 
                      1.A.2.1.       OXYGEN 
                      3. Oxygen is a colourless, odourless gas that supports combustion and life. It is a major factor to 
                      be considered during survival in the DISSUB. Oxygen sources in the DISSUB include ambient 
                      air, compressed oxygen cylinders, oxygen-generating chemicals and for some systems even 
                      LOX (liquid oxygen). 
                      a. Oxygen Consumption. In a DISSUB, it is expected that the survivors will be at a minimal 
                      activity level, since complete rest minimises oxygen consumption (and CO                                       2 production). Oxygen 
                      consumption in a DISSUB has been shown to range from 20 to 40 litres/man/hour at STP                                                (ii). 
                      b. The following value should be used in the calculation of life support stores requirements and 
                      stay times prior to submarine escape or rescue: 
                      Oxygen usage: 27 litres/man/hour at STP                      (iii)
                      c. Physiological Constraints. It is the partial pressure of oxygen that is important physiologically. 
                      The partial pressure of O            2 in the tissues is 0.07 bar and the normal partial pressure of oxygen in 
                      air at STP is 0.2 bar. If this gradient is reduced too much, the tissues become deficient in oxygen 
                      and ill health effects ensue (the effects of hypoxia). Table 1.A-1 illustrates the acute affects of 
                      hypoxia caused by a sudden reduction in the partial pressure of oxygen. 
                                                                                                                                    Edition (A) Version (1)

                                                                                        stimulated by hypoxia

                                                  0.06                                  Death 
                      d. It is important to note that a gradual reduction in the partial pressure of oxygen will result in 
                      some acclimatisation to the effects of hypoxia (in the 0.18 - 0.13 bar range). Thus, the survivors 
                      may remain sufficiently alert to enable them to assist during the rescue procedures down to 
                      partial pressure of around 0.13 bar (however note para. 4.b. regarding escape). 
                      e. A raised partial pressure of oxygen can also be harmful. The signs and symptoms of 
                      pulmonary oxygen toxicity become progressively worse above an O                                      2  partial pressure of 0.5 bar. 
                      Pulmonary oxygen toxicity increases the risks involved during escape and rescue. Cerebral 
                      oxygen toxicity may occur if the partial pressure of O                               2  exceeds 1.6 bar; the most obvious 
                      manifestation of this is convulsions. 
                      f. Above a fractional concentration of 23% oxygen becomes a significant fire hazard within the 
                      DISSUB and Rescue Submersible. 
                      Advice on Oxygen 
                      4. Onboard the DISSUB: 
                      a. Whenever possible both following parameters should be maintained                                       for as long as possible 
                      -    oxygen partial pressure between 0.15 bar and 0.5 bar (physiological matters); 
                      -    oxygen concentration lower than 23% volume (fire hazard matters). 
                      b. When oxygen regeneration sources have been exhausted, the oxygen partial pressure will 
                      fall. In the absence of instructions from the surface, escape should be planned such that the 
                      partial pressure of oxygen does not fall below 0.13 bar at the end of the escape procedure. 
                      c. It is acceptable to await rescue down to a partial pressure of 0.13 bar. 
                      1.A.2.2.       CARBON DIOXIDE 
                      5. Carbon dioxide is a colourless and odourless gas at normal temperatures and pressures. 
                      Denser than air, it may accumulate in low areas. It is a dangerous product of combustion. It is 
                      also a product of respiration and is directly related to the amount of oxygen consumed by the 
                      body. Carbon dioxide production is minimised by complete rest, but can readily double with 
                      physical activity: 
                                                                                                                                    Edition (A) Version (1) 
                                                                                         1.A-2

                      a. CO    2 production. In a DISSUB, it is expected that the crew will be at a minimal activity level. 
                      The following minimum value should be used in the calculation of life support stores 
                      requirements and stay times prior to submarine escape or rescue. 
                      Carbon Dioxide production: 23 litres/man/hour at STP                           (iii)
                      b. Physiological Constraints. As with oxygen it is the partial pressure of CO                                       2  that is important 
                      physiologically. The partial pressure of CO
                      pressure of CO                                                    2 in the tissues is 0.07 bar and the normal partial 
                      retain excessive amounts of CO2  in air at 1 bar is 0.0003 bar. If this gradient is sufficiently reduced the tissues 
                                                                     2 (hypercapnoea) and ill health effects ensue. 
                      c. In the DISSUB scenario a rising CO                            2   partial pressure is likely to become a limiting 
                      physiological factor well in advance of any problems with falling oxygen. The partial pressure of 
                      CO   2 may rise suddenly due to rapid pressurisation or a fire. Alternatively the survivors may be 
                      subjected to a gradual increase in the partial pressure as they await rescue. The physiological 
                      response to the two scenarios is different as there is some adaptation to chronic exposure. 
                      Table 1.A-2 and Table 1.A-3 illustrate the differences.

                      acceptable for escape. There is some evidence that hypercapnoea increases carbon 2
                      monoxide(CO) toxicity (see CO section) and central nervous system oxygen toxicity. 
                      Advice on Carbon Dioxide 
                      6. Onboard the DISSUB the carbon dioxide partial pressure should be kept below the following 
                      limit for as long as possible: 
                      a. Less than or equal to 0.03 bar 
                      b. In the absence of instructions from the surface, escape should be planned such that the 
                      partial pressure of carbon dioxide does not exceed 0.05 bar at the end of the escape. 
                      1.A.2.3.       CARBON MONOXIDE 
                      7. Carbon Monoxide (CO) is a dangerous product of incomplete combustion. It is a colourless, 
                      tasteless, odourless gas with a density almost equal to that of air. CO competes with oxygen for 
                      the haemoglobin molecules within the blood stream (the haemoglobin molecule transports 
                      oxygen to the body tissues). Carbon Monoxide's affinity for haemoglobin is some 200 times 
                      greater than that of oxygen. Consequently, carbon monoxide attaches to the haemoglobin in 
                      preference to the oxygen and produces an insidious hypoxia (lack of oxygen) within the body 
                      tissues. There is a dose dependant reaction. 
                      8. CO poisoning not only reduces the oxygen carrying capacity of blood but also exerts toxic 
                      effects directly on the cell by blocking a critical enzyme (cytochrome a3 oxidase). Victims 
                      surviving the immediate intoxication may experience long term health effects (e.g. memory and 
                      mood disturbances, headache) due to damage of cells in the nervous system. Little is known of 
                      low concentration/long duration exposure to CO. Table 1.A-4 demonstrates the consequences of 
                      inhaling CO when breathing contaminated air (partial pressure of oxygen 0.2 bar) at 1 bar. 
                      9. Table 1.A-4 indicates expected levels of toxicity based on normoxia and it is important to note 
                      that any reduction in the oxygen partial pressure will worsen and hasten symptoms of CO 
                      toxicity. Conversely, a raised oxygen partial pressure (greater the 0.2 bar) will lessen the 
                      production of carboxyhaemoglobin and thus delay development of CO toxicity. An increased 
                      partial pressure of CO           2 is believed to facilitate the toxic effects of CO. 
                      10. Therefore, within the DISSUB the ambient pressure (assumed boundaries of 1 - 5 bar), the 
                      partial pressure of oxygen, CO and CO                     2 will all act as independent but interrelated variables with 
                      the body tissues. As a consequence of this complexity, the provision of advice as to what 
                      constitutes a safe level of exposure to CO whilst considering escape or rescue is difficult.

                      Advice on Carbon Monoxide 
                      11. Advice on escape and rescue must be extrapolated from the known effects produced by 
                      short term exposures. As such the advice is, at best, very rudimentary. 
                      a. Advice on Escape. Escaping from a submarine with moderate or severe symptoms would 
                      impose a significant risk due to the decreased physical and mental capacity. Thus symptoms 
                      may be used as a crude measure of toxicity. However, it should be noted that similar symptoms 
                      due to CO      2 intoxication and other contaminants might further confuse the picture. 
                      (1) Mild Symptoms: headache; dizziness; exertion dyspnoea; decreased visual acuity; some 
                      impairment of higher cerebral function. 
                      (2) Moderate Symptoms: severe headache; irritability; reduced judgement; nausea; worsening 
                      dizziness. 
                      (3) Severe Symptoms: fainting; convulsions; paralysis; coma; respiratory and cardiac arrest. 
                      b. Advice on Rescue. A continuous exposure of up to 200 ppm may still allow survivors to 
                      undertake the required DISSUB tasks to effect a rescue within 7 days. Above this level the acute 
                      effects will severely reduce physical and mental abilities. Some long-term health complications 
                      are to be expected.

                      1.A.2.4.       CHLORINE 
                      12. Chlorine      (vi)is produced as a result of electrolysis of sodium chloride containing solutions. Any 
                      uninsulated voltage underwater, like flooding above the submarine batteries, may produce Cl
                      gas. Chlorine gas is heavier than air therefore it may be confined to the lower levels of the                                                 2
                      escape compartment. 
                      13. Chlorine is a simple irritant and has no metabolic effect within the body. The main danger is 
                      damage to the lower respiratory tract due to the irritant action. This will ultimately result in life 
                      threatening pulmonary oedema. The effects on the human body are well understood. Table 
                      1.A-5 summarizes the results from numerous experimental and industrial studies.

                                               100                                Tolerable for a maximum of 1 minute. 
                                               430                                Lowest lethal conc. for a 30 min. exposure.

                      14. If the presence of chlorine is suspected it should be measured for on a regular basis. The 
                      survivors must balance the risk of chlorine exposure against the risks of escape (depth, 
                      pressure, surface conditions) and awaiting rescue. Some chlorine induced lung damage may be 
                      acceptable in the knowledge that the rescue vehicle is expected. Conversely, lung damage may 
                      reduce the survivor's ability to escape and survive on the surface.

                      16. Traditionally it was considered that over a period of days the DISSUB internal temperature 
                      will tend to approach the surrounding sea water temperature                                     (vii)(viii)(ix). However a number of 
                      recent SURVIVEXs have cast doubt on this view and have shown that either the fall in DISSUB 
                      temperature is significantly slower                (x) or indeed there may actually be a rise in temperature as 
                      result of metabolic heat production by the crew and heat produced as a result of the exothermic 
                      reaction when lithium hydroxide or soda-lime (both widely used as CO
                      and O                                                                                                    2 absorbents) absorb CO              2
                               2 candles. Thus there is some doubt as to what might actually happen and this will also be 
                      dependent on ambient sea temperatures. 
                      17. Low temperatures may cause hypothermia (core temperature of 35Â°C or below) and non-
                      freezing cold injury to the skin. Wet clothing will exacerbate the problem. Shivering will increase 
                      oxygen consumption, carbon dioxide production and consequently decrease DISSUB survival

                      time. Additional thermal protection, extra to the normal working clothing, is required to prevent 
                      hypothermia and non freezing cold injury in cold conditions                               (xi). Hypothermic patients should be 
                      placed in upper bunks if facilities and patient monitoring allows, as the vertical atmospheric 
                      temperature gradient may be significant. 
                      18. High temperatures will cause hyperthermia. The body will attempt to lower core temperature 
                      by increased sweating; this mechanism will be impaired if the humidity is also elevated, which is 
                      considered to be highly likely. Increased sweating will result eventually in dehydration; this can 
                      be prevented by allowing survivors to drink as much water as is possible. Additionally attempts 
                      should be made to cool hyperthermic survivors, this can be achieved relatively effectively by 
                      immersing extremities in cool water, sea water should provide a plentiful supply. 
                      19. Surviving on meagre rations has been shown to cause hypoglycaemia, starvation diarrhoea, 
                      headache, backache, low urine output leading to renal failure and exacerbate the effects of 
                      hypothermia. Furthermore, the ability to perform an escape or rescue procedure is severely 
                      restricted by the lack of adequate fluid and calorific intake. Consequently, the minimum fluid 
                      intake should be 1 litre per day per man and the minimum calorific intake should be 1250kcal per 
                      day per man. In addition, 1000kcal should be available to be eaten just prior to escape                                         (xi). 
                      20. Attention must be paid to hygiene issues to prevent the spread of infectious disease. If at all 
                      possible hand washing should be performed prior to eating, handling food and after defaecation. 
                      Faecal material must be isolated in plastic bags. A gastrointestinal infection, in combination with 
                      other DISSUB stress factors, may make participation in any rescue procedure impossible due to 
                      hypovolaemia and hypoglycaemia. Each escape compartment should contain medical stores to 
                      deal with the conditions envisaged. The provision of antiseptic wipes (non-alcohol based) should 
                      be considered as a means of improving personal hygiene.

                              CHAPTER 2 -  SUBMARINE ESCAPE AND SURFACE SURVIVAL 
                                                        PERSONNEL EQUIPMENT (SESSPE) 
                      2.1.  PURPOSE 
                      This chapter defines the minimum requirements for SESSPE to enable a submarine escapee to 
                      make a safe ascent from a DISSUB and survive on the surface pending rescue. 
                      2.2. GENERAL 
                      The primary function of the SESSPE is to enable the user to make a safe ascent from the 
                      DISSUB to the surface. 
                      Secondary functions include the provision of: 
                      a. Adequate buoyancy, stability, self righting and wave-splash protection to prevent 
                      drowning. 
                      b. Adequate design to enable the user to vomit without aspiration, if seasick on the surface. 
                      c. Seals at wrists and face/neck to minimize ingress of seawater. 
                      d. Sufficient insulation to minimize the incidence of hypothermia and cold injury in cold sea 
                      and weather conditions. 
                      e. Suitable location aids to enable detection by surface ships and aircraft. 
                      f. To reduce the incidence of hypothermia, the suit shall have means of minimizing fluid 
                      accumulation within the SESSPE due to urine production, both for men and women. 
                      2.3. DETAILS 
                      The SESSPE should be: 
                      a. of universal size to fit all users, 
                      b. worn in conjunction with additional clothing to slow the onset of general hypothermia, 
                      c. The suit or its associated life raft should be fitted with a battery operated SOLAS 
                      approved light to aid in the detection of survivors, 
                      d. packaged to prevent degradation during storage in as small a presentation as possible, 
                      e. fully usable within 5 minutes of withdrawal from storage and must not immobilize the 
                      wearer, 
                      f. functionally safe to the maximum escape depth that a human body can handle. 
                      The SESSPE must be conspicuous and brightly coloured to aid visual detection. During ascent: 
                      a. the wearer must be able to breath air normally, 
                      b. the SESSPE must be provided with a reliable system for venting excess air from the suit 
                      and from the built-in buoyancy, 
                      c. stability should not be compromised by design features.
                                                                                                                                    Edition (A) Version (1) 
                                                                                           2-1

                      There should be a means of: 
                      a. minimizing fluid accumulation within the SESSPE due to urine production, 
                      b. grasping the survivor to facilitate removing him from the water.
                      If the SESSPE is fitted with a life raft, the life raft should have the following requirements: 
                      a. adequate buoyancy, stability and wave-splash protection, 
                      b. sufficient insulation to minimise the incidence of hypothermia and cold injury in cold sea and 
                      weather conditions, 
                      c. suitable location aids to enable detection by surface ships and aircraft. 
                      The life raft should be: 
                      a. of universal size to fit all users, 
                      b. fitted with a battery operated SOLAS approved luminous beacon to aid in the detection of 
                      survivors, 
                      c. packaged to prevent degradation during storage and must not immobilize the wearer to allow 
                      easy access into the escape tower, 
                      d. maximum inflation time to be no longer than 90 seconds and fitted with a manual secondary 
                      inflation system. Manual water removal system is also to be fitted, 
                      e. equipped with a drogue, 
                      f. the life raft must be conspicuous and brightly coloured to aid visual detection, 
                      g. life rafts fitted with protective canopies must provide a ventilation system to avoid CO2 build 
                      up, 
                      h . life raft must be capable of being manually âre                    - rightedâ.

                                                               TRAINING TANK CANDIDATES 
                      3.1. PURPOSE 
                      This chapter defines the minimum requirements to ensure that foreign students being trained in 
                      a submarine escape training tank are medically fit for such training. 
                      3.2. DETAILS 
                      a. The requirements cover training in submarine escape training tank (SET), but not escape 
                           training from a submerged submarine. 
                      b. Definitions: The host nation is the nation providing SET training. The client nation is the 
                           nation requesting SET training. 
                      c.   The host nation holds overall responsibility for the safety of the SET training. 
                      d. The client nation has the responsibility for assessment of medical fitness according to the 
                           host nation  standards. However, the medical authority of the host nation has the privilege to 
                           re- assess the candidateâs medical fitness and may disqualify the candidate for training if 
                           he/she is found medically unfit. 
                      e. The decision of medical fitness should be based on the assumption that no underlying 
                           disorder exists which may represent a risk for the candidate during SET training. The 
                           objective of this chapter is not to define examination applicable for submarine service in 
                           general. 
                      f.   The decision of medical fitness should be based on a thorough medical investigation and 
                           subsequent assessment. The minimum extent of such investigation is detailed in ANNEX 
                           3.A, but this should be expanded as considered necessary by the client nation medical 
                           authority. Dependent on the nature of the SET training, national military or civilian 
                           regulations applicable for the host nation or development of medical knowledge, the host 
                           nation may require extension of the examinations beyond what is identified in ANNEX 3.A. 
                      g. The decision of medical fitness for SET training should be signed by a service physician 
                           trained in diving medicine. The physician should be authorized by an appropriate national 
                           medical authorisation agency for such responsibility. Host nation may request copy of such 
                           letter of approval. Details of the content of the medical certificate are given in ANNEX 3.B. 
                      h. A certificate of medical fitness for SET training has a maximum validity of three months 
                           following the examination unless otherwise agreed between host and client nation. 
                      i.   Pass/fail criteria for the medical examination is detailed in ANNEX 3.C. As described in 
                           Serial e above         this should be decided on the candidateâs ability to perf                          orm training in a safe 
                           manner. If the examining physician considers the candidate fit for SET training, in spite of the 
                           guidance provided in ANNEX 3.C, this should be detailed on the medical certificate. The 
                           client nation has the responsibility to bring details of such a decision to the attention and final 
                           approval of the host nation at the earliest opportunity. 
                                                                                                                                    Edition (A) Version (1)

                                              ANNEX 3.A. MEDICAL EXAMINATION OF SET CANDIDATES 
                      3.A.1. GENERAL 
                      1. The examination should include assessment of the medical history, a clinical examination 
                           and additional examinations as detailed in this document. The examining physician has the 
                           responsibility to investigate the candidate on an individual basis, extending the examinations 
                           listed below as considered necessary. 
                      2. The medical information should be filed in writing or electronic format in agreement with 
                           national regulations. The host nation may request a copy of the results. 
                      3.A.2. MEDICAL HISTORY 
                      3.   The medical history should be addressed by a questionnaire as well as a personal interview 
                           by the examining physician. The questionnaire and interview shall address the social 
                           relationships and service history, family medical history, malformations, previous illnesses 
                           and injuries, present complaints, use of recreational drugs, alcohol and tobacco as well as 
                           medication and allergies. In specific any problems related with previous diving and SET 
                           training should be addressed. 
                      4. The medical history is considered the most important part of the medical examination and 
                           should be investigated and documented in detail. 
                      3.A.3. CLINICAL EXAMINATION 
                      5.   As a minimum these clinical examinations should be completed:

                        ANNEX 3.C. GUIDELINE FOR ASSESSMENT OF MEDICAL FITNESS FOR SET TRAINING 
                                                                           (PASS/FAIL CRITERIA) 
                      3.C.1. INTRODUCTION 
                      1.   The investigation of candidates with conditions which might make them unfit is to be initiated 
                           by the examining physician of the client nation, with specialist opinions sought as 
                           appropriate. The candidate is to be considered temporarily medically unfit until a definitive 
                           decision is made. 
                      2. If investigation fails to resolve the issue of fitness, the examining physician of the client 
                           nation should send all relevant information to the medical authority of the host nation for 
                           review. The medical authority of the host nation may overrule a decision of medical fitness 
                           issued by the client nation. 
                      3. It is important to consider fitness for SET training whenever these personnel attend for a 
                           medical consultation, whether in a primary or secondary care setting. A relevant medical 
                           condition will have an immediate effect on the fitness for pressure exposure - and, although 
                           prospective submarine escape candidates might not be due to attend for pressurised training 
                           for some considerable time, they can face unnecessary delay if assessment is not initiated at 
                           the earliest possible opportunity. 
                      3.C.2. MEDICAL STANDARDS 
                      4.   A decision of medical fitness for SET training should be based on the candidateâs ability to 
                           perform the training in a safe manner, not exposing him/herself or instructors to risk due to 
                           pre-existing medical disorder. 
                      5. Candidates must be physically and mentally fit and be without evidence of emotional 
                           instability. There is no upper age limit, but the discretion of the examining physician should 
                           be exercised when assessing the level of general fitness. 
                      3.C.3. CONDITIONS INFLUENCING FITNESS FOR SUBMARINE ESCAPE TRAINING 
                      6.   It is not possible to provide a comprehensive list of conditions which permanently exclude a 
                           candidate. Frequently, a decision is based on the extent of the abnormality or the severity of 
                           disease and the individual response to treatment. Conditions which have a bearing on fitness 
                           for diving and submarine escape are listed below. By scrutiny of medical documents, direct 
                           questioning and physical examination, the following conditions must be excluded. Where 
                           positively elicited or identified, these conditions are normally grounds for rejection. However, 
                           in cases of doubt, the condition should be discussed with the medical authority of the host 
                           nation. 
                      3.C.4. GENERAL 
                      7. Candidates         â age   must be consistent with host nation regulations. 
                      8.   Hearing and eyesight must be to the General Service standard of the appropriate branch. 
                      9. There are no specific height or weight restrictions to submarine escape training. The 
                           trainee's size must not be so extreme as to prevent donning a Submarine Escape Immersion 
                           Suit or from negotiating the escape tower without risk of becoming stuck. Potential 
                           candidates taller than 2 metres should have the opportunity of trying a suit for size at the 
                           earliest opportunity in order to avoid nugatory training. 
                                                                                                                                    Edition (A) Version (1) 
                                                                                         3.C-1

                      3.C.5. DERMATOLOGICAL CONDITIONS 
                      10. Chronic or acute skin disorder, including the cutaneous manifestations of systemic disease, 
                           other than mild, localised conditions, may disqualify a candidate. A decision of fitness or 
                           unfitness should be based on the risk of skin infections and whether water exposure may 
                           worsen the disorder. 
                      3.C.6. EARS, NOSE AND THROAT CONDITIONS 
                      11. The following conditions render a candidate unfit for pressure exposures: 
                           a. Chronic or recurrent sinusitis. 
                           b.    Chronic or recurrent outer or middle ear discharge. 
                           c.    Severe allergic conditions of the upper respiratory tract. 
                           d.    Meniereâs Disease
                           e. Previous stapes surgery. 
                           f.    Perforation of the tympanic membrane, unless adequately healed or surgically corrected. 
                      12. The following conditions render a candidate, or qualified diver, temporarily unfit for pressure 
                           exposures and should be referred to an ENT Specialist: 
                           a. Viral labyrinthitis. 
                           b. A history of ENT surgery. 
                      13. Hearing should be examined by pure tone audiometry to a standard acceptable to the host 
                           nations. The tympanic membrane must be clearly seen on examination with evidence of 
                           satisfactory Eustachian tube function and adequate ear-clearing by observing the ear drum 
                           to be mobile while a Valsalva manoeuvre is performed. Where doubt exists and in the 
                           absence of an upper respiratory infection or inflammation, a cautious exposure to pressure 
                           should be carried out in a compression chamber. Continued failure to clear ears should be 
                           cause for referral to an ENT consultant for formal assessment of Eustachian tube function. 
                      14. Exostoses are acceptable provided they do not occlude the external auditory canal. 
                      3.C.7. RESPIRATORY DISORDERS 
                      15. Pulmonary function test (PFT), as a minimum dynamic spirometry measuring FVC, FEV1 
                           and PEF, should be completed with an accuracy and methodology meeting current standard 
                           of the European Respiratory Society or other recognized international professional society 
                           for pulmonary medicine. 
                      16. FVC and FEV1 should not be less than the threshold limit. The threshold limit is defined as 
                           two standard deviations (SD) lower than the expected value based on applicable population 
                           reference values. If the estimation the exact threshold value (Ref.value                                                â   2 SD) is 
                           impractical, 80% of reference value may be used. FEV1/FVC should exceed 75%. If these 
                           values are not reached, the candidate should be reassessed, and if the values continue to 
                           remain less than threshold values, the patient should be referred to a chest physician. 
                      17. The following conditions will render a candidate unfit for pressurised SET training: 
                           a.    Symptomatic asthma or other form of recurring bronchospasm. 
                           b.    Chronic obstructive airways disease or areas of potential air trapping such as lung cysts, 
                                 bullae and blebs; pleural effusion; lung fistula; bronchiectasis; pulmonary fibrosis; 
                                 neoplasm and unresolved pneumothorax; moderate or severe lung emphysema. 
                                                                                                                                    Edition (A) Version (1) 
                                                                                         3.C-2

                           c. Pulmonary tuberculosis - unless limited to an isolated healed and calcified peripheral 
                                 primary focus (Ghon focus). Such lesions are not necessarily an automatic bar to 
                                 submarine escape training. 
                           d.    Active sarcoidosis or other restrictive pulmonary condition. 
                           e. Any lung disease, abnormality or penetrating chest injury likely to result in areas of 
                                 altered lung compliance and / or pleural adhesions. Candidates with a history of 
                                 pneumonia with x-ray changes should be presented to and discussed with the medical 
                                 authority of the host nation. 
                      18. Candidates with a past history of reversible, obstructive airways disease are judged on an 
                           individual basis. Isolated attacks of bronchospasm in association with frank chest infections 
                           should be discussed with the medical authority of the host nation. It is very important to 
                           identify any tendency to recurring obstructive airways disease. A current history consistent 
                           with bronchoconstriction on exercise or in a cold environment is an absolute contra-
                           indication to pressure exposure - the candidate should be made unfit for SET training. 
                      19. Candidates with the following histories should be investigated by a chest physician or as a 
                           minimum asked to keep a PEF diary: 
                           a.    past history consistent with reversible bronchoconstriction, 
                           b. current history of questionable significance, 
                           c. allergen-mediated bronchoconstriction. 
                      20. The PEF diary should be kept for 28 days, recording best of 3 efforts: 
                           a.    on waking and at 1800 each day, 
                           b.    pre- and post-exercise, making a note of this on the diary, 
                           c.    if the candidate feels wheezy or short of breath, making a note of this on the diary. 
                      21. If an occupational exposure is suspected then readings should be taken every 4 hours while 
                           awake and every 2 hours while at work, with careful notes of circumstances at each reading. 
                           If variability that is not attributable to occupational exposure is 15 % or greater then the 
                           candidate should be made unfit for SET training. 
                      22. If the specialist laboratory shows no evidence of abnormal bronchial lability in response to a 
                           challenge or bronchodilator then the candidate may be found fit for pressure exposures. 
                      23. A history of perforating chest injury or open chest surgery may disqualify if there is evidence 
                           of residual pulmonary or pleural scarring. The reason for the surgery is to be established. All 
                           such cases should be discussed with the medical authority of the host nation. 
                      24. Pneumothorax, other than spontaneous, may be acceptable providing at least three months 
                           have elapsed since resolution and it has been determined by detailed pulmonary function 
                           assessment that no residual impairment remains. All such cases should be discussed with 
                           the medical authority of the host nation. 
                      25. A history of spontaneous pneumothorax usually precludes pressure exposures. Individuals 
                           who have been recurrence-free for at least five years and in whom it has been determined 
                           by detailed pulmonary function assessment that no residual impairment remains may, in 
                           exceptional circumstances, be permitted to undergo SET training. All such cases should be 
                           reviewed by the medical authority of the host nation. 
                      3.C.8. CARDIOVASCULAR CONDITIONS 
                      26. The following conditions will render a candidate unfit: 
                           a. Any organic heart disease. 
                                                                                                                                    Edition (A) Version (1) 
                                                                                         3.C-3

                           b. Coarctation of the aorta. 
                      27. The following conditions must be referred for specialist cardiological opinion prior to review 
                           by the host nation medical authority. 
                           a.    Significant atrial or ventricular septal defects, or other potential right to left shunts. These 
                                 conditions are usually incompatible with pressure exposure unless surgically corrected. 
                                 Primary screening for right to left shunts, however, is not currently considered justifiable. 
                           b.    Cases of valvular stenosis or regurgitation. 
                           c.    Any history of coronary insufficiency or myocardial ischaemia, even if treated by coronary 
                                 bypass grafting. 
                           d. Cardiomegaly unless it is established by specialist investigation to be the consequence 
                                 of athletic training. 
                           e. All arrhythmias except sinus arrhythmias and ventricular extrasystoles which disappear 
                                 with increasing heart rate. 
                           f.    Conduction defects. Right bundle branch block may not require specialist referral if 
                                 considered an isolated finding. 
                      28. Abnormalities found on cardiovascular examination, such as murmurs, and on ECG must be 
                           investigated to an appropriate extent before a decision on fitness is made. 
                      3.C.9. ALIMENTARY SYSTEM CONDITIONS 
                      29. The following condition will render the candidate unfit: 
                           a.    Abdominal wall herniation unless adequately repaired. 
                      30. The following conditions must be referred for specialist opinion prior to review by the host 
                           nation medical authority. 
                           a. Chronic inflammatory bowel disease. 
                           b.    Acute or chronic active hepatic disease. 
                           c. History of pancreatitis. 
                      3.C.10. MUSCULO-SKELETAL CONDITIONS 
                      31. Candidates must have unimpeded mobility and dexterity. Any limitation should be assessed 
                           on the basis of the candidateâs ability to perform his work or undertake training and, 
                           particularly, its possible impact on safety. 
                      32. The presence of juxta-               articular (âAâ) lesions of dysbaric osteonecrosis precludes further 
                           pressure exposures. 
                      33. Successful surgery for prolapsed intervertebral disc may be acceptable provided 
                           neurological examination is normal and there is no functional impairment. 
                      34. Musculoskeletal, or referred, pain that might mimic decompression illness must be assessed 
                           carefully. If any doubt exists, the case should be discussed with the medical authority of the 
                           host nation. 
                      3.C.11. NERVOUS SYSTEM CONDITIONS 
                      35. Neurological abnormalities should merit specialist referral. 
                      36. Conditions with the potential to preclude pressure exposure are as follows: 
                           a. Epilepsy, including petit mal and partial seizures, and irrespective of any treatment. 
                                 Febrile convulsions up to the age of five years should not be considered a bar to 
                                 pressure exposure. Individuals who have suffered an isolated seizure but who are not 
                                                                                                                                    Edition (A) Version (1) 
                                                                                         3.C-4

                                 considered to be suffering from epilepsy, should be reviewed by the medical authority of 
                                 the host nation. 
                           b. Intracranial surgery. 
                           c. Severe speech impediment. 
                           d. Severe motion sickness. 
                           e. Migraine unless mild and unaccompanied by visual, speech, motor or sensory 
                                 disturbance. 
                      37. Head injury accompanied by skull fracture or resulting in loss of consciousness or post-
                           traumatic amnesia may result in increased risk of convulsion. This may be further increased 
                           by high inspired partial pressures of oxygen. A history of severe head injury is a permanent 
                           bar. Candidates with a history of a moderate head injury may be considered fit for pressure 
                           exposure after a period of 1 year without sequelae but will require referral to a Diving 
                           Medicine Specialist and will be assessed on an individual basis . Candidates with a history of 
                           mild head injury may be considered fit for pressure exposure after a period of 1 month 
                           without sequelae but will require referral a Diving Medicine Specialist and will be assessed 
                           on an individual basis. 
                           a.    Severe head injuries have one or more of the following features: 
                                        -   brain contusion (diagnosed on the basis of observation during surgery or focal 
                                              neurological symptoms), 
                                        - intracranial haematoma, 
                                        -   loss of consciousness or post-traumatic amnesia for more than 24 hours. 
                           b.    Moderate head injuries have one or more of the following features: 
                                        -   loss of consciousness or post-traumatic amnesia lasting 30 minutes to 24 hours. 
                                        - skull fracture. 
                           c. Mild head injuries have 
                                        -  an absence of fracture, 
                                        -    loss of consciousness or post-traumatic amnesia for less than 30 minutes. 
                           d. Candidates whose severe head injury occurred more than 10 years prior to the medical 
                                 and in whom there is no evidence of neurological sequelae may, in exceptional 
                                 circumstances, be permitted to undertake SET, but all such cases must be referred to a 
                                 Diving Medicine Specialist. 
                      38. A history of bacterial or viral meningitis or encephalitis is compatible with pressure exposure 
                           provided that the candidate has been asymptomatic for 12 months and there is no evidence 
                           of neurological sequelae. 
                      3.C.12. MENTAL HEALTH 
                      39. Psychiatric illness other than minor reactive or transient non-recurring conditions. A history of 
                           past or present psychiatric or psychological disorder, including abuse of alcohol or drugs, 
                           should be considered a contraindication to pressure exposures unless the examining 
                           physician is content, having taken specialist advice if indicated, that it is of a minor nature 
                           and unlikely to recur. Past or present evidence of alcohol or drug abuse is not suitable for 
                           SET training unless a consultant psychiatric opinion is favourable. These latter cases should 
                           be reviewed by the medical authority of the host nation. 
                                                                                                                                    Edition (A) Version (1) 
                                                                                         3.C-5

                      3.C.13. GENITO-URINARY CONDITIONS 
                      40. Renal calculi and malformations of the urinary system will be cause for rejection unless 
                           adequately treated. 
                      41. Sexually transmitted diseases will disqualify until successfully treated. Although specific 
                           testing does not form part of a routine medical examination, HIV positive candidates should 
                           be dealt with in accordance with host and client nations policies. 
                      3.C.14. ENDOCRINE DISORDERS 
                      42. Detailed specialist investigation of endocrine conditions is not normally required. However, 
                           where abnormalities are detected clinically, these should be investigated. 
                      43. Diabetes mellitus requiring insulin and/or oral hypoglycaemic agents is an absolute 
                           contraindication. Subjects with diabetes mellitus controlled by diet alone are usually 
                           considered fit for SET training unless end-organ injury or a history of other complication 
                           exists. 
                      3.C.15. HAEMATOLOGICAL CONDITIONS 
                      44. Abnormalities revealed should be referred for specialist assessment. 
                      45. Asymptomatic sickle cell trait is not a contraindication to pressure exposure and individuals 
                           with frank sickle cell disease will be unfit for entry into military service. Routine testing for 
                           sickle cell disease is thus not required. Haemoglobin electrophoresis may be carried out if 
                           required at the initial medical. 
                      3.C.16. DENTAL STANDARDS 
                      46. Candidates require a high standard of dental fitness. Teeth should be sound or adequately 
                           restored (no caries) and the gum and supporting bones should be healthy. 
                      47.  Crowns and fixed bridgework must be scrutinised annually. If in doubt as to a candidateâs 
                           dental fitness, the examining physician should seek the opinion of a dental officer. 
                      3.C.17. GENDER 
                      48. These standards apply to both genders. Pregnancy is a contraindication for SET training. 
                           Post-partum candidates should be evaluated against host and client nations regulations. 
                                                                                                                                    Edition (A) Version (1) 
                                                                                         3.C-6
