1.1        SCOPE AND RESPONSIBILITIES 
                      1.         Aerospace medicine is the specialty of medicine concerning the determination 
                      and maintenance of the health, safety, and performance of those who fly or control 
                      systems in the air and space environments. It encompasses aspects of occupational, 
                      preventive, and primary care medicine. Aerospace medicine supports air operations 
                      and is especially effective when employed in a proactive manner; anticipating, 
                      recognizing, and controlling factors adversely impacting human health, safety and 
                      performance; and promoting those opportunities which may sustain and optimize 
                      performance. 
                      2.         The military applications of this specialty currently include the support of both 
                      manned and unmanned aircraft operations. This includes the aeromedical 
                      requirements for aviation personnel of all armed services, the medical risks for flight 
                      passengers, the standards for aeromedical evacuation, and the ergonomics and 
                      human factors applicable to health, fitness and safety in the air and space 
                      environments. 
                      3.         Within the context of NATO, member nations provide subject matter experts in 
                      the field of aerospace medicine to serve as delegates of the Aeromedical Working 
                      Group (AMDWG).                     This working group reports to the Military Committee Air 
                      Standardization Board. STANAGs promulgated through the AMDWG promote 
                      standardization and interoperability of aeromedical evacuation operations and 
                      equipment, in direct support of the military aviator and air operations. AMDWG 
                      coordinates and liaises with Committee of Chiefs of Military Medical Services 
                      (COMEDS) and the medical panels of other NATO medical working groups to ensure 
                      concordance with and support to the development of general medical standardization 
                      documents. 
                      4.         This doctrine is written to lay the foundation for what are considered to be the 
                      core components of an aerospace medicine capability expected for any NATO nation. 
                      This will allow for greater ease of interoperability and set the foundation for future 
                      operational partnerships. In furthering interoperability, NATO nations are working with 
                      nations involved in other international fora such as the European Air Group (EAG) and 
                      the Air and Space Interoperability Council (ASIC).                                     This doctrine is subordinate to 
                      NATO Publication AJP-4.10(B) Allied Joint Medical Support Doctrine and amplifies 
                      Section 1.3.2 - Air Operations, paragraphs 1-4.
