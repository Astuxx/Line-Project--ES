                                                                  CHAPTER 1 INTRODUCTION 
                      1.1        SCOPE AND RESPONSIBILITIES 
                      1.         Aerospace medicine is the specialty of medicine concerning the determination 
                      and maintenance of the health, safety, and performance of those who fly or control 
                      systems in the air and space environments. It encompasses aspects of occupational, 
                      preventive, and primary care medicine. Aerospace medicine supports air operations 
                      and is especially effective when employed in a proactive manner; anticipating, 
                      recognizing, and controlling factors adversely impacting human health, safety and 
                      performance; and promoting those opportunities which may sustain and optimize 
                      performance. 
                      2.         The military applications of this specialty currently include the support of both 
                      manned and unmanned aircraft operations. This includes the aeromedical 
                      requirements for aviation personnel of all armed services, the medical risks for flight 
                      passengers, the standards for aeromedical evacuation, and the ergonomics and 
                      human factors applicable to health, fitness and safety in the air and space 
                      environments. 
                      3.         Within the context of NATO, member nations provide subject matter experts in 
                      the field of aerospace medicine to serve as delegates of the Aeromedical Working 
                      Group (AMDWG).                     This working group reports to the Military Committee Air 
                      Standardization Board. STANAGs promulgated through the AMDWG promote 
                      standardization and interoperability of aeromedical evacuation operations and 
                      equipment, in direct support of the military aviator and air operations. AMDWG 
                      coordinates and liaises with Committee of Chiefs of Military Medical Services 
                      (COMEDS) and the medical panels of other NATO medical working groups to ensure 
                      concordance with and support to the development of general medical standardization 
                      documents. 
                      4.         This doctrine is written to lay the foundation for what are considered to be the 
                      core components of an aerospace medicine capability expected for any NATO nation. 
                      This will allow for greater ease of interoperability and set the foundation for future 
                      operational partnerships. In furthering interoperability, NATO nations are working with 
                      nations involved in other international fora such as the European Air Group (EAG) and 
                      the Air and Space Interoperability Council (ASIC).                                     This doctrine is subordinate to 
                      NATO Publication AJP-4.10(B) Allied Joint Medical Support Doctrine and amplifies 
                      Section 1.3.2 - Air Operations, paragraphs 1-4. 
                                                                                         1-1                                 Edition A Version 1

                      support of their operational military aerospace commanders, across a broad range of 
                      air and space missions, to include expeditionary war-fighting, peacekeeping, and 
                      humanitarian assistance.

                      national aerospace medicine programme, including training of aerospace medicine 
                      personnel, oversight of support to air operations and the aeromedical evacuation 
                      system. 
                      3.         Flight Surgeon - A flight surgeon is a physician who has undergone a recognized 
                      training programme in aerospace medicine who is authorized to conduct aircrew 
                      medical examination, provision of day to day medical care of aircrew including 
                      determination of fitness to fly, and provide aerospace medical support to aircrew and 
                      their chain of command. In addition to having skills and knowledge in general and 
                      aerospace medicine, flight surgeons are also required to obtain and maintain 
                      knowledge and experience in the aviation environment. This should include the 
                      occupational stressors and hazards of the cockpit/aircraft interior as well as those of 
                      the missions flown by the aircrew. The flight surgeon should also spend sufficient time 
                      with the aircrew at the base or squadron level in the non-flying environment in order to 
                      develop and maintain situational awareness of the other issues affecting them. The 
                      local flight surgeon is part of the flight safety programme at base level and a flight 
                      surgeon should also be part of the national military flight safety programme. Flight 
                      surgeons may be augmented by other health care providers such as physician 
                      assistants who also have defined training in aerospace medicine. This will vary among 
                      nations. 
                      4.         Flight Nurse- A flight nurse is a nurse who is specially qualified to provide safe 
                      medical care to patients in the aeromedical evacuation environment. 
                      5.         Flight medic- A flight medic is a medical technician who is utilized in aeromedical 
                      evacuation teams. In those nations that use them, flight medics have defined roles and 
                      responsibilities in the aeromedical evacuation environment. 
                                                                                         2-1                                 Edition A Version 1

                      6.         Specialist physicians and nurses (anaesthesiologists, intensivists, critical care 
                      nurses, pediatricians, etc.)- These specialist personnel augment aeromedical 
                      evacuation teams when dealing with seriously ill patients during flight. These 
                      specialists may also be used as augmentees to standing AE teams or may be part of 
                      a defined Critical Care Air Transport Team/Critical Care Air Support Team 
                      (CCATT/CCAST). These specialist teams are sometimes augmented by respiratory 
                      technicians and other personnel as required, depending on national policy and 
                      resources. 
                      7.         Physiologists- Physiologists may be military or civilian personnel. They may 
                      have varying degrees of formal military and flying roles depending on their nation's 
                      policies. Aerospace physiologists may be involved in research, human factors analysis 
                      and aeromedical training. In some nations, these roles are conducted by flight 
                      surgeons. 
                      8.         Nations may have other personnel, military and civilian, that are involved in the 
                      support of aerospace medicine. They may work in a variety of areas including but not 
                      confined to noise and vibration, psychology, physiology, equipment design, test and 
                      evaluation (e.g., helmet, night vision systems, oxygen systems), anthropometry, bio-
                      dynamics and CBRN. 
                                                                                         2-2                                 Edition A Version 1

                                      CHAPTER 3 SUPPORT TO AIR TRAINING AND OPERATIONS 
                      3.1        TYPES OF SUPPORT 
                      1.         Clinical support: Flight surgeons apply aeromedical risk assessment in 
                      determining fitness to fly at aircrew selection and throughout service, including follow 
                      up after illness or injury. An effective aerospace medicine programme ensures a fit and 
                      healthy force, timely treatment of illness and injury, and management of hazards and 
                      risks to health in the air and space environments. It should be emphasized that minor 
                      medical conditions, when exposed to the aviation environment, may have a significant 
                      impact on flight safety or mission success. 
                      2.         Medical Advice to the chain of Command: Flight surgeons provide advice to the 
                      operational chain of command on matters related to health, safety, and well being of 
                      aircrew. This advice should help identify and mitigate operational risk in areas such as 
                      fatigue, night operations, life support equipment and special operational environments 
                      (high altitude, cold, heat, etc). It is essential that the flight surgeon be able to liaise 
                      closely and authoritatively with both medical and air operations chains of command. 
                      3.         Planning: Aeromedical input must be provided early in the operations planning 
                      process on such matters as, provision of healthcare, aeromedical evacuation, aircrew 
                      performance                 optimization,               clinical           timelines,             CBRN,               multinational 
                      coordination/interoperability, and emergency support to airfield operations. 
                                                                                         3-1                                 Edition A Version 1

                                                    CHAPTER 4 ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE 
                      4.1        CONSIDERATIONS FOR THE ORGANIZATION OF AN AEROSPACE 
                      MEDICINE SERVICE 
                      1.         Each member nation will have its own organizational structure to oversee and 
                      administer aeromedical policy and standards. Policy and standards development 
                      should, at a minimum, include, medical aspects of flight safety, aircrew medical 
                      standards (selection and retention), approved medications, aircrew preventive 
                      medicine, and aeromedical evacuation. 
                      2.         Additionally, the organizational structure should provide the following: 
                                 a.         A system of clinical governance/oversight. This would be included in the 
                                            wider, national military medical governance and oversight system but 
                                            should have aerospace medicine specialists overseeing the aerospace 
                                            medicine programme. 
                                 b.         Consultation Service - This is a group of specialist physicians, who 
                                            should have training in aerospace medicine and who have experience in 
                                            the disposition of aircrew with complex pathology. They may work 
                                            together in the same geographic location or work as a virtual group. 
                                 c.         Center     âs of Aviation Medicine               - Some nations have research institutions 
                                            to promote and support specialist knowledge, research and development 
                                            in areas important to aerospace medicine. Additionally, nations may have 
                                            schools for the training of aeromedical personnel and aircrew. 
                                                                                         4-1                                 Edition A Version 1

                                      CHAPTER 5 AEROSPACE MEDICINE PERSONNEL TRAINING 
                      5.1        OVERVIEW 
                      Aerospace medicine personnel require specialized training in order to fulfill their duties. 
                      This training will provide these personnel with the competencies to perform their 
                      specific duties in the air and space environments. In all cases, appropriate evaluation 
                      procedures (formal written and/or practical exams, assignments etc) will be utilized to 
                      confirm personnel have attained the expected standards. Ongoing clinical and practical 
                      evaluation will continue throughout the individual's service including participation in 
                      exercises in the operational context. 
                      5.2        AEROSPACE MEDICINE/FLIGHT SURGEON TRAINING 
                      1.         Flight surgeons must demonstrate satisfactory completion of a nationally 
                      recognized aerospace medicine course covering physiological, clinical and 
                      psychological factors that impact on the ability of aircrew to operate in an air or space 
                      environment. It should also include familiarity with aircrew life support and safety 
                      equipment and air operations. 
                      2.         It should be emphasized that flight surgeons should become more familiar with 
                      life support and safety systems peculiar to the aircraft types which are at the bases to 
                      which they are assigned. Any nation that has aircrew CBRN systems should include 
                      training in the operation and potential problems of these systems for their flight 
                      surgeons (or military aerospace physiologists for those nations that have them). 
                      3.         To maintain competency, a system of refresher training should be provided. It 
                      should emphasize the practical application of basic principles and provide updates on 
                      the clinical management of conditions relevant to aerospace medicine. It should be 
                      conducted on a regular basis as per national standards or requirements. 
                      5.3        ADVANCED AEROSPACE MEDICINE/FLIGHT SURGEON TRAINING 
                      This training is defined as higher training in aerospace medicine which gives a broader 
                      and more in-depth education in the academic and practical aspects of aerospace 
                      medicine. There are various courses worldwide which provide this type of training. This 
                      training will allow these practitioners to hold more senior and advanced positions in the 
                      aerospace medicine community providing higher levels of advice and oversight. 
                      Ideally, this training should include some level of flying exposure including ground 
                      school and basic hands-on flying training. 
                                                                                         5-1                                 Edition A Version 1

                      safety and optimize performance. Components of an aircrew aeromedical training 
                      program should include: 
                                 a.         Aeromedical training as described in STANAG 3114. It should be noted 
                                            that there should be medical oversight of aeromedical training, program 
                                            development and review. Not all nations may have all components of a 
                                            full aeromedical training program (e.g. centrifuge). 
                                 b.         Human Factors training - Many nations mandate human factors training 
                                            for aircrew and ground crew. The thrust of this training is to recognize 
                                            errors in procedures, policies etc, in order to prevent accidents. 
                      2.         Special areas such as CBRN and night vision devices, if used by a given nation, 
                      will necessitate specialized training as required. Such specialized training is defined in 
                      different STANAGs. It should be emphasized that aerospace medicine personnel 
                      should be involved in this type of training but are not necessarily overall responsible 
                      for it.

                      7.1        ROLES OF AEROSPACE MEDICINE PERSONNEL IN A FLIGHT SAFETY 
                      PROGRAMME 
                      Aerospace medicine plays a vital role in achieving and maintaining the highest level of 
                      military aviation safety. Medical certification and management of aircrew and 
                      maintenance personnel are key aerospace medicine activities that influence flight 
                      safety. Further, aerospace medicine should be integrated into formal flight safety 
                      programs to include accident/incident investigations, flight safety promotion and 
                      education, and provide independent review/advice on policy, standards and 
                      procedures. To be most effective, aerospace medicine personnel must be well 
                      integrated into line unit activities and actively participate in the unit flying mission. 
                      7.2        ACCIDENT/INCIDENT INVESTIGATION 
                      The aerospace medicine component of aviation accident/incident investigations 
                      considers the medical and human factors, survivability, performance of life support 
                      systems, escape systems, and aircrew equipment assemblies. The primary goal of 
                      investigations is to develop effective and practical preventive measures that will reduce 
                      the risk of a reoccurrence or decrease the severity of consequences and injury. All 
                      flight surgeons must have an understanding of the principles of accident/incident 
                      investigation and evidence preservation. Investigating flight surgeons must have 
                      additional formal training and practical experience to develop the required level of 
                      competency to participate in or provide advice to the flight safety investigation board. 
                      Flight      surgeon          consultation            with      experts         in    human          factors        (physiologists, 
                      psychologists), safety equipment, and engineering is essential in gaining an 
                      understanding of critical factors related to the accident/incident.

                      MEDICINE 
                      Aerospace medicine is underpinned by a strong research capability that advances 
                      fundamental aerospace medicine knowledge, enabling development and evaluation of 
                      equipment and development of contemporary evidence-based policy and standards. 
                      Aerospace medicine personnel should be engaged in all phases of aviation system 
                      acquisitions to provide consultation and design expertise to optimize the interface 
                      between the human and the system. Specifically, human systems integration principles 
                      should be utilized early in the design and acquisition of new aircraft systems including 
                      unmanned aircraft systems. Aerospace medicine personnel need to keep abreast of 
                      novel concepts in manned and unmanned aerospace platforms in order to ensure they 
                      continue to be able to deliver their mandate in this rapidly expanding area of air 
                      operations.
