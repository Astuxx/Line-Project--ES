(BASED UPON THE JOINT EXCESS OF LOSS COMMITTEE CLAUSES - CL400 - 01/11/2003)
1. REINSURANCE CLAUSE
1.1 In consideration of the premium to be paid to reinsurers by or on behalf of the reassured, the
reinsurers hereon shall reimburse the reassured to the extent that its net loss (as defined
in Clause 2 below) under business reinsured by this Contract exceeds the reassured's
retention but only up to the limit of reimbursement. Such business is as fully described in
the RISK DETAILS which forms an integral part of this Contract.
1.2 The period of reinsurance, the reassured's retention, the limit of reimbursement, the premium
and other matters are as fully described in the RISK DETAILS.
1.3 This Contract is subject to all limits, terms, conditions and exclusions contained herein and in
the RISK DETAILS.
1.4 Each reinsurer shall be liable only for its own respective proportion.
1.5 It is a condition precedent to liability under this Contract that settlement by the reassured shall
be in accordance with the terms, conditions and exclusions of the original policies or
contracts.
2. NET LOSS
2.1 "Net loss" under this Contract means the sum actually paid by the reassured in discharge of its
liability for loss (as defined in Clause 3 below) after deduction of all salvage and recovery,
including recovery from all reinsurances other than those that may be specified in the
RISK DETAILS.
2.2 "Payment" in these clauses requires that funds have been transferred by the payer, with "paid"
being construed accordingly.
2.3 The reinsurers shall not be obliged to reimburse the reassured unless and until (and then only
to the extent that) the reassured has discharged, by actual payment, its liability for its
current net loss.
2.4 The reassured may claim on the basis of its current net loss, notwithstanding that the net loss
may vary in future as a result of further relevant payments made or received by the
reassured.
2.5 Where salvage, recovery or other payment is received or recovered by the reassured after a
payment by reinsurers under this Contract, the reimbursement shall be adjusted as if such
receipt or recovery occurred before the payment by reinsurers was made.
2.6 Liability of the reinsurers hereon in respect of any loss hereunder shall not be increased by the
reassured's failure to collect any amount due from any other reinsurer.

shall be determined by treating the loss as arising on the date of discovery of the loss by

be determined by treating the loss as arising on the date when the circumstance giving

arising from that event shall be treated as occurring during the currency of this Contract.

amount awarded against an insurer or reinsurer found liable by a court of competent
jurisdiction to pay damages to an assured or reassured in respect of the insurer's or
reinsurer's conduct of a claim made against it under any policy or contract where such
liability has arisen because of:
7.2.1 the failure of the insurer or reinsurer to agree or pay a claim within the policy limits or
to provide a defence against such claims as required by law, or
7.2.2 bad faith or negligence in rejecting an offer of settlement, or
7.2.3 negligence or breach of duty in the preparation of the defence or the conduct of a
trial or the preparation or prosecution of any appeal or subrogation or any
subsequent action arising therefrom.
7.3 Any additional cover against extra-contractual obligations shall only be under the terms of
Clause A (Extra-Contractual Obligations Inclusion) in the Annex of Additional Clauses
printed below and must be specified in the RISK DETAILS.
8. SEEPAGE AND POLLUTION EXCLUSION

reason of this clause it shall be for the Reassured to prove the contrary.

The reassured's books and records shall be open to inspection by authorized representatives of
the reinsurers at any reasonable time during the existence of this Contract or of any liability
hereunder.

reinsurer reside or carry on business or are incorporated, this Contract shall be
automatically terminated forthwith.

consequence of any law or regulation in any country or territory, or if any law or regulation
shall prevent directly or indirectly the remittance of any payment due to or from either party,
the party so constrained shall give immediate written advice thereof to the other party, who

A.2.2 any extra-contractual obligation arising from the fraud of a director, officer or
employee of the reassured acting individually or collectively or in collusion with
an individual or corporation or with any other organisation or party involved in the
presentation defence or settlement of any claim.
A.3 The reinsurers' liability hereunder in respect of any one such loss is subject to the terms,

provided herein in respect of each loss. Furthermore, the following specific provisions
shall take precedence in the event of any inconsistency.
A.4 Any payment of claims related extra-contractual obligations shall for the purpose of this
Contract be deemed to be a loss arising from the same event as that giving rise to the
claim to which the extra-contractual obligation award is related.

proportional and non-proportional protection effected by the reassured shall provide or be
deemed to provide pro-rata coverage for such obligations.
B. AGGREGATE VOYAGE EXTENSION (CARGO)
B.1 Where cargo business is included in the RISK DETAILS as reinsured hereunder the reassured
may, if it requires, aggregate cargo losses of the same nature (including liability for such
loss or damage and related expenses including general average contribution, salvage
charges and expenses incurred to avert or minimise such loss or damage) and treat them
as losses arising from one event provided that
B.1.1 it is not possible to determine the quantum of loss applicable to separate events,
and that
B.1.2 such losses are in respect of cargo carried in the same vessel for the same or an
overlapping voyage.
B.2 The date of loss in such cases shall be deemed to be the date of arrival at the port of
discharge of such cargo or the date of discovery of loss if earlier. If such cargo is
discharged at more than one port, the date of loss shall be deemed to be the date of
arrival at the first port of discharge or the date of discovery of loss if earlier.
B.3 Claims paid by the reassured in respect of any interests other than cargo as described above
are specifically excluded from the protection afforded by this clause.
B.4 The reinsurers' liability hereunder in respect of any one such aggregate loss is subject to the
terms, conditions and exclusions of this Contract, and shall not exceed the limit of
reimbursement provided herein in respect of each loss.
C. COLLUSION
C.1 The reassured may aggregate settlements of losses to any single direct assured which arise
from infidelity or fraud committed by any person acting alone or by persons acting in
collusion, whether incurred in respect of
C.1.1 claims on direct policies, or
C.1.2 under the terms of any reinsurance.
C.2 Such settlements may not be aggregated under this Contract if they have been settled
C.2.1 as separate losses under the direct policies, or
C.2.2 under separate direct policy years.
C.3 Nevertheless, settlements defined under C.2.2 shall be admissible for that portion of loss
which is attributable to any one policy year.
C.4 The date of loss shall be determined by treating the loss as arising on the date of first
discovery of loss by the direct assured.

D. INSOLVENCY
D.1 Where an insolvency event occurs in relation to a reassured the following terms shall apply
(and, in the event of any inconsistency between these terms and any other terms of the
Contract, these terms shall prevail):
D.1.1 Notwithstanding any requirement in this Contract that a reassured shall actually
make payment in discharge of its liability to its policyholder before becoming
entitled to payment from the reinsurer:
D.1.1.1 the reinsurer shall be liable to pay the reassured even though the
reassured is unable to actually pay, or to discharge its liability to, its
policyholder; but
D.1.1.2 nothing in this clause shall operate to accelerate the date for payment by
the reinsurer of any sum which may be payable to the reassured, which
sum shall only become payable as and when the reassured would
have discharged, by actual payment, its liability for its current net loss
but for it being the subject of an insolvency event.
D.1.2 The existence, quantum, valuation and date for payment of any sums which the
reinsurer is liable to pay the reassured under this Contract shall be those and
only those for which the reinsurer would be liable to the reassured if the liability
of the reassured had been determined without reference to any term in any
composition or scheme of arrangement, entered into between the reassured and
all or any part of its policyholders unless and until the reinsurer serves written
notice to the contrary on the reassured in relation to any composition or scheme
of arrangement.
D.1.3 The reinsurer shall be entitled (but not obliged) to set off, against any sum which it
may be liable to pay the reassured, any sum for which the reassured is liable to
pay the reinsurer.
D.2 An insolvency event shall occur if:
D.2.1 (in relation to D.1.1, D.1.2 and D.1.3 above) a winding up petition is presented in
respect of the reassured or a provisional liquidator is appointed over it or if the
reassured goes into administration, administrative receivership or receivership or
if the reassured has a scheme of arrangement proposed in relation to all or any
parts of its affairs; or
D.2.2 (in relation to D.1.1 above) if the reassured goes into compulsory or voluntary
liquidation;

D.2.3 or, in each case, if the reassured becomes subject to any other similar
insolvency process (whether under the laws of England and Wales or elsewhere)

possession of the U.S.A., or any province or territory of Canada, to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable law.

(RE)INSURER’S
LIABILITY:
(RE)INSURERS LIABILITY CLAUSE
(Re)insurer’s liability several not joint
The liability of a (re)insurer under this contract is several and not joint with
other (re)insurers party to this contract. A (re)insurer is liable only for the
proportion of liability it has underwritten. A (re)insurer is not jointly liable for
the proportion of liability underwritten by any other (re)insurer. Nor is a
(re)insurer otherwise responsible for any liability of any other (re)insurer that
may underwrite this contract.
The proportion of liability under this contract underwritten by a (re)insurer (or,
in the case of a Lloyd’s syndicate, the total of the proportions underwritten
by all the members of the syndicate taken together) is shown next to its
stamp. This is subject always to the provision concerning “signing” below.
In the case of a Lloyd’s syndicate, each member of the syndicate (rather
than the syndicate itself) is a (re)insurer. Each member has underwritten a
proportion of the total shown for the syndicate (that total itself being the total
of the proportions underwritten by all the members of the syndicate taken
together). The liability of each member of the syndicate is several and not
joint with other members. A member is liable only for that member’s
proportion. A member is not jointly liable for any other member’s proportion.
Nor is any member otherwise responsible for any liability of any other
(re)insurer that may underwrite this contract. The business address of each
member is Lloyd’s, One Lime Street, London EC3M 7HA. The identity of
each member of a Lloyd’s syndicate and their respective proportion may be
obtained by writing to Market Services, Lloyd’s, at the above address.
Proportion of liability
Unless there is “signing” (see below), the proportion of liability under this
contract underwritten by each (re)insurer (or, in the case of a Lloyd’s
syndicate, the total of the proportions underwritten by all the members of the
syndicate taken together) is shown next to its stamp and is referred to as its
“written line”.
Where this contract permits, written lines, or certain written lines, may be
adjusted (“signed”). In that case a schedule is to be appended to this
contract to show the definitive proportion of liability under this contract
underwritten by each (re)insurer (or, in the case of a Lloyd’s syndicate, the
total of the proportions underwritten by all the members of the syndicate
taken together). A definitive proportion (or, in the case of a Lloyd’s
syndicate, the total of the proportions underwritten by all the members of a
Lloyd’s syndicate taken together) is referred to as a “signed line”. The

signed lines shown in the schedule will prevail over the written lines unless
a proven error in calculation has occurred.

reference to contracts in the plural.
